We would essentially have to have a convincing decoy to pretend Velocity looked and smelled like a BungeeCord implementation to a plugin, while not actually being based on BungeeCord. This would force us to introduce ever more elaborate decoys to pretend to be bug-for-bug and binary compatible with BungeeCord, which would force us to spend time on ensuring compatibility with every BungeeCord plugin ever rather than delivering new features.
